# Diagramator

More easy than diagram as code. Diagram as yaml + templates

## Requirements

- Nodejs 14 as a minimum

## Commands?

It's pretty easy... You do not have a bunch of commands, just two of them:

- `npm install` – to install libraries
- `npm run dev` – to start with development

Open `http://localhost:8080`. You should see something like this:

- `npm run build` - to make it ready for production use

## Roadmap

- move public to src
- unit tests
- ui/ux to be more like a yaml editor
- export to image button
- copy image to clipboard
- horizontal split pane (editor/canvas) resize <->
